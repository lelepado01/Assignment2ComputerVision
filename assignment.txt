The literature has shown a large number of algorithms for feature detection in images. 
The goal of the assignment is to implement and test the performances of at least 
two different feature detectors (see for example SIFT, SURF, ORB and similar)
complemented with a tracking algorithm, as for example the Good Features to Track, Kalman, etc. 

You will be provided with a test video to be used for the evaluation. 

The delivery consists of: 

    source code
    short report with implementation and validation details, as well as a commentary on the obtained results
    a short videoclip showing the output
    a presentation in the form of a short video (max 4 min) in which you illustrate the methodology you have followed and the obtained results.

For the presentation video, please DO NOT upload the video directly. Provide instead a link to YouTube/Video/GDrive source.
